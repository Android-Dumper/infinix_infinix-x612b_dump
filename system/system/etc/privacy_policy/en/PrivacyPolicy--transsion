<h1>III.How We Store and Protect <u>Your</u> Personal Information</h1>

The personal information collected based on your consent will be stored in accordance with the laws and regulations on personal privacy data protection of the countries concerned. To the extent not prohibited by local laws and regulations, we may also store the collected personal information in countries or regions outside the country where the business is located.
<br /><br />
Whether we store personal information in the country where the business is located, or in other countries or regions to the extent that doing so does not violate laws and regulations, we will retain it in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations on data storage. At the same time, we will consider the characteristics, scope and purpose of personal information processing, the risks that may be encountered in the processing, and the serious consequences caused by the damage, etc., and implement the necessary security measures. For example: we will use encryption and de-identification methods to store the collected personal information. We will also keep the information for the shortest storage period specified by law. For those not specified by law, we will retain the information according to the shortest storage period required for business. For data that exceeds the storage period, or data that you request us to delete, we will delete said data accordingly or take other appropriate measures without violating the relevant laws and regulations. In addition, we will take other necessary measures to protect the security of your personal information and prevent data from being misused, unauthorized access, and unauthorized modification, disclosure or destruction, etc.
<br /><br />
Nevertheless, we need to remind you that no matter how perfect the measures are, there is no absolute guarantee of avoiding the occurrence of data storage security incidents. If a security breach occurs, we will report it to the corresponding regulatory authorities as required by the relevant laws and regulations, and provide the type of personal data involved in the breach, the number of data subjects, the possible consequences of the breach, and the remedial measures we intend to take according to the requirements of the regulatory authorities. We will take the best possible measures to remedy or mitigate the damage and consequences of data leakage. When permitted or required by laws and regulations, we will inform you of the possible consequences or significant damage to you in a timely manner, so that you can take appropriate measures promptly to protect your rights as much as possible.
<br /><br />
There is no absolutely safe website, Internet transmission, computer system and wireless connections. Except the necessary protective measures we have taken, users have to strengthen the awareness of privacy security risks. For example, when you jump from our services to third-party websites, links, products or services, for the security of any data collected by those websites, links, products or services, please read through the terms and conditions of those third parties carefully. We do not assume any legal responsibility for data security issues caused by such third parties. If you find that certain contents, advertisements or functions in our websites, products or services may be provided by a third party and may possibly endanger your privacy and security, please contact us promptly, as we will handle it with priority in accordance with laws and regulations.

<h1>IV.How We Share, Transfer and Disclose Your Personal Information and Data</h1>

In sharing, transferring, and disclosing your personal information, we uphold the principles and requirements of minimization, necessity, and legality. Under normal circumstances, we do not share, transfer or disclose your personal information externally. However, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, we may share, transfer and disclose your personal information in the following situations:
<br /><br />
In order to provide you with timely services, your personal information may be shared with TECNO affiliated companies. We will only share your information within TECNO affiliated companies for legitimate and explicit purposes, and only share the information necessary to provide the services, and are bound by the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.

<br /><br />
We may share the necessary personal information with authorized third-party partners (including logistics service providers, data storage service providers, after-sales service providers, marketing promotion service providers, etc.) for the performance of certain functions or to provide you with better service and a better user experience. For example: when you purchase TECNO products, TECNO may need to provide your relevant personal information to the logistics service provider to arrange delivery; when providing you with after-sales service, we may need to provide your relevant personal information to the after-sales service provider in order to offer better service and support. We uphold the principles of minimization, necessity, and legality to carry out such sharing.

<br /><br />
In order to provide evaluation, analysis or other business services, we may also share your non-personal information with third parties, for example: we may use aggregated data to help partners (such as advertising service providers) understand the effectiveness, feedback and usage trends of their services.
<br /><br />
In the event of a merger, acquisition or bankruptcy liquidation, asset transfer and other related transaction, if a personal information transfer is involved, we will require the new company or organization holding your personal information to continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy through an agreement or other appropriate measures, and we will require such subject to take confidentiality and security measures of a degree no less than the requirements of this Policy to process personal information.

<h1>V.How Your Personal Information is Transferred Across Borders</h1>

In principle, we do not charge a fee for your lawful and reasonable request, but we will charge a certain fee for repeated requests that exceed the reasonable limit where applicable. We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require excessive technical means (for example, to develop new systems or fundamentally change existing practices), pose risks to the legal rights of others or are very unrealistic, or violate the mandatory provisions by law.
